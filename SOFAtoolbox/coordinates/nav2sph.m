function [azi,ele]=nav2sph(azi,ele)
%NAV2SPH - Transform coordinates from nagigational to spherical coordinates.
%	Usage: [azi,ele] = nav2sph(azi,ele)
%
%	Input:
%       azi : azimuth (-180 <= azi <= 180)
%       ele : elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
%
%   Output:
%       azi : azimuth (0 <= azi < 360)
%       ele : elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
%
