function [azi,ele] = sph2nav(azi,ele)
%SPH2NAV - Convert spherical coordinates to navigational coordinates.
%   Usage: [azi,ele] = sph2nav(azi,ele) 
%
%   Input:
%       azi : azimuth (0 <= azi < 360)
%       ele : elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
%
%   Output:
%       azi : azimuth (-180 <= azi <= 180)
%       ele : elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
