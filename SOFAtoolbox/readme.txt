This is a readme file for the SOFA Toolbox for Matlab and Octave.

* Add the "SOFAtoolbox" directory to Matlab search path: Use "Add Folder" (don't use "Add with Subfolders"!)
* Start the Toolbox: execute "SOFAstart" in Matlab or Octave.
* No HRTF files to play around? Follow the advices in the readme.txt files in the data directories.
* Explore the Toolbox: execute some of the "demo_" files in the directory "demos".
* Learn more about SOFA: read the specs PDF in the directory "doc".
* Report a bug: send a ticket at https://github.com/sofacoustics/SOFAtoolbox/issues.
* Last changes? check the file "history.txt".

Tested with Matlab R2018b (and higher) and Octave 4.2.1.
